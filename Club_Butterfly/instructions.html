    <h1>Welcome to VennWave</h1>
    <p>A platform for creating an immersive, adaptive, and non-linear musical experience. The following page will guide you through everything you need to know in order to create your own experience and share it with the world.</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the experience itself is meant primarily for mobile devices, the platform is currently only available for desktop.</p>
    <p>So let’s begin, shall we?</p>

    <h2>Login</h2>
    <p>When opening the platform’s main page, most of the menu will be disabled, including the ‘Open’ and ‘Save’ actions. To use these functions, click ‘Login with Google Account’. A window will open, allowing you to use an existing Google account or create a new one. Once you are logged in, the ‘Open’ and ‘Save’ options will become available.</p>

    <h2>Composition Name</h2>
    <p>When you first open the platform, a randomly generated name will be suggested. To change it, click the pencil icon next to the composition’s name. This will open an input box where you can type a new name. Click outside the input box to save the new name.</p>

    <h2>The Menu</h2>
    <h3>New</h3>
    <p>Clicking ‘New’ will clear all information and present an empty composition canvas with a new name suggestion. If you have unsaved changes, a prompt will appear asking you to confirm the action or cancel.</p>
    
    <h3>Open</h3>
    <p>Clicking ‘Open’ will display all your saved compositions. Clicking on one will open it. If you have unsaved changes, a prompt will ask for confirmation. You can delete a composition by clicking the ‘trash’ icon next to its name.</p>
    
    <h3>Save</h3>
    <p>Clicking ‘Save’ stores the composition in your account and uploads new sounds. Once done, the ‘Save’ option will change to ‘Saved’.</p>
    
    <h3>Share</h3>
    <p>This option is enabled only after saving. Clicking ‘Share’ generates a link and a QR code for mobile access. You can also copy the link using the ‘copy’ icon.</p>

    <h2>The Canvas</h2>
    <p>The composition canvas is where you place sounds to create a virtual space for listeners.</p>
    
    <h3>Creating a New Sound Area</h3>
    <p>Drag and drop an audio file onto the canvas to create a sound area with an inner and outer circle.</p>

    <h3>The Inner Circle</h3>
    <p>Represents full volume and centered panning. Drag to reposition it. Resize by dragging its edges.</p>
    
    <h3>The Outer Circle</h3>
    <p>Defines the audible area, where volume and panning change based on the listener’s position. Resize by dragging its edges.</p>
    
    <h3>Symmetrize</h3>
    <p>Clicking the ‘Symmetrize’ icon at the top left of the canvas automatically aligns sound areas.</p>
    
    <h2>The Sound Area Editor</h3>
    <p>Double-clicking an inner circle opens the editor in the right pane. Here, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rename the sound area</li>
        <li>Change the sound area color</li>
        <li>Adjust the sound area position and size</li>
        <li>Toggle looping or non-looping</li>
        <li>Navigate between sound areas</li>
        <li>Delete the sound area</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Playback and Navigation</h2>
    <h3>Play Button</h3>
    <p>Click to play or stop the composition.</p>
    
    <h3>Drag/Autopilot Button</h3>
    <p>Switches between ‘drag mode’ (manually move the listener) and ‘autopilot mode’ (automatic movement). A speed slider appears in autopilot mode.</p>
    
    <h3>Info Button</h3>
    <p>Displays quick instructions for using the composition canvas.</p>

    <h3>Dark/Light Mode</h3>
    <p>Located at the top right of the screen, this toggle switches between light mode and dark mode.</p>
